# Willis

ZMK config template for the [Willis](https://github.com/krikun98/Willis).

Create a repository from this template and enable Actions to build your firmware.

Both the regular and Studio-enabled firmware versions are available.

I would also advise looking at [Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku_zmk), which is an excellent option for boards this small.
